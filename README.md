Script Explanation
•	Simulates health events coming from a mobile SDK
•	Validates schema, type-checks each record
•	Cleans and transforms to analytics-ready Parquet
•	Includes realistic error handling
•	Designed to plug into Airflow as a daily or hourly job
Where this fits in the architecture (from Part 1)
Ingestion: Raw JSON lands on S3 from the Kinesis Firehose stream or batch backfill.

Transformation: This script would be orchestrated by Airflow (MWAA) to pick up the raw JSON, validate + transform it into Parquet on S3 (curated zone).

Serving: The resulting Parquet could be queried directly in Athena, or loaded into a warehouse or feature store for further ML/analytics work.

In other words, this is your “clean & validate” layer in the pipeline, between the raw zone (object storage) and curated zone (warehouse / Iceberg tables).

Scheduling & Orchestration: 
Wrap this script in a Docker image for easy portability
Trigger with Airflow using a PythonOperator or DockerOperator
Schedule it hourly or daily, depending on event volume
Add Airflow sensors to watch for raw_events.json arrival on S3
Add a downstream data quality check (e.g., dbt or Great Expectations)
Store logs centrally (CloudWatch or similar)
Version the code in Git, deploy through CI/CD

Senior Engineer Notes: 
In a real pipeline, you’d extend this to handle GDPR deletes (e.g., check a deletion list before re-writing to Parquet).

You might also replace Pandas with PySpark for higher throughput if processing millions of events per hour.

This simple pattern, though, is perfect for a PoC or a mid-scale pipeline.
